V1: 
-It's not converging;
-Corner solutions haven't been taken into account;
-It will never converge, for the future choices are the same as the current; but
they are in a different state! brt1,bft1,bgt1 must all be changed.

Current:
-Modification from V1 -> For a given state of nature, the agent's current 
choice will be evaluated on tomorrow's bonds holding as well;
-All solutions (corner and interior) will be calculated separately in
different functions;
-brt1, bft1 and bgt1, will be calculated differently from the above case;
