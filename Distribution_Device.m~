%DEFAULT DECISION IS FOUND BY A LINEAR PROGRAMMING METHOD

%CONCAVE UTILITY FUNCTIONS

%NO PRODUCTIVITY SHOCKS ONTO THE FIRM

%CONSTANT TAX RATE

%SYMMETRIC TRANSITION MATRIX AMONG STATES OF NATURE
%REGARDING SHOCKS

%THERE IS WEALTH GROWTH AND IT IS STOCHASTIC: THERE WILL BE
%A GOOD AND A BAD STATE OF NATURE

%IN THE GOOD STATE, WEALTH IS SPLITTED EVENLY AMONG
%CONSUMERS

%IN THE BAD STATE THE DISTRIBUTION OF WEALTH IS
%STOCHASTIC, BUT THE LIKELIHOOD OF EITHER A BAD OR GOOD
%STATES ARE THE SAME

%WITH THAT, WE CAN REWRITE ALL VARIABLES, AND MAKE THEM
%RELATIVE TO AGGREGATE WEALTH

%BOND'S MARKET WILL BE CONSIDERED CLEARED FOR ALL THE
%STATES
